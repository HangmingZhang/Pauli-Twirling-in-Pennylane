# Pauli-Twirling-in-Pennylane <br> <br>

Hi everyone! This library shares a simple and direct implementation of Pauli Twirling—a key technique in quantum error mitigation—using the PennyLane framework.<br> <br>

We’ve implemented Pauli twirling in PennyLane by directly modeling its mathematical formulation. While this approach might differ slightly from practical implementations, our main focus is to:<br>

Experimentally verify the correctness of Pauli twirling in a simple way.<br>

Provide an intuitive understanding of what Pauli twirling actually does.<br><br>

So far, most existing implementations of Pauli twirling (that I’ve seen) use IBM’s Qiskit. I haven’t come across any implementations using PennyLane—so here we are, building it with PennyLane!<br> <br>

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out—don’t hesitate! Thanks, everyone!
